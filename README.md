# Timeseries-forecasting-With-Python
In this project I performed some timeseries forecasting on real life data using Python. 

## Data
Data was wetched from unofficial OldSchool RuneScape wiki -page which has price information for all of the items in the game. Data was then manipulated to the form fitting timeseries forecasting.

## Algorithms
1. Arima an it's different variations
2. Holt-Winter's Seasonal Smoothing
3. XGBoost

## Findings
- With complex real life data, one would ideally want large dataset to recognize patterns better.
- With Complex datasets, Arima/HWSS -models are often not enough to catch all the patterns.
- XGBoost can perform relatively well even with smaller datasets.
- When analyzing timeseries data, it's important to understand your dataset and how it is formed.
